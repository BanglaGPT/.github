# BanglaGPT
BanglaGPT is a project implementing a powerful GPT language model for Bangla. It aims to address the lack of language models for Bangla, enabling applications like chatbots, translation, sentiment analysis, and more. Its goal is to empower developers and researchers working with the Bangla language.

## Tokenizer for Bangla Text
The initial phase of the BanglaGPT project is finished, delivering a customized tokenizer for Bangla text. This tokenizer efficiently breaks down sentences into tokens, considering the language's complexities, facilitating analysis and processing.

## Future Roadmaps
We have an ambitious roadmap ahead for the BanglaGPT project. Here are some of the key areas we plan to focus on in the future:

* GPT Model Training

* Model Evaluation and Benchmarking

* Model Optimization

* Domain-Specific Adaptation
  
## Contributing
We strongly encourage contributions from the open-source community to help us achieve the goals of the BanglaGPT project. Whether you are a researcher, developer, or language enthusiast, there are several ways you can contribute:

* **Testing and Feedback:** Try out the tokenizer and provide valuable feedback. Report any issues, suggest improvements, or share your experiences working with the tokenizer.

* **Dataset Collection:** Help us gather diverse datasets in Bangla for training and evaluation purposes. High-quality and representative datasets are crucial for building robust language models.

* **Model Training:** Contribute to the training process by providing computational resources, expertise in machine learning, or by sharing preprocessed datasets that can be used to train the GPT model.

* **Documentation and Code:** Improve the documentation of the project, write tutorials, or contribute to the codebase. Help us make BanglaGPT more accessible to the community.
