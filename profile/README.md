# BanglaGPT
Welcome to the BanglaGPT project! This project aims to implement the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model for the Bangla language. By leveraging the power of natural language processing and deep learning, our goal is to provide a comprehensive and efficient language model specifically designed for Bangla speakers.

## Purpose
The purpose of BanglaGPT is to enable natural language understanding and generation in Bangla. The lack of widely available language models for the Bangla language has been a significant barrier to the development of various applications such as chatbots, language translation, sentiment analysis, and more. By building a GPT-based model for Bangla, we aim to bridge this gap and empower developers and researchers to work on a wide range of Bangla language-related projects.

## Tokenizer for Bangla Text
The first milestone of the BanglaGPT project has been completed, which involved creating a tokenizer specifically tailored for Bangla text. Tokenization is a crucial step in natural language processing, as it breaks down sentences into individual tokens or subwords, enabling further analysis and processing. The tokenizer developed for BanglaGPT provides a robust and efficient way to tokenize Bangla text, taking into account the intricacies of the language's structure and script.

## Future Roadmaps
We have an ambitious roadmap ahead for the BanglaGPT project. Here are some of the key areas we plan to focus on in the future:

* **GPT Model Training:** The next step is to train a GPT model on a large corpus of Bangla text. This involves pretraining the model on a diverse range of data sources to capture the statistical patterns and linguistic nuances of the Bangla language. Fine-tuning will be performed on specific downstream tasks to enhance the model's performance.

* **Model Evaluation and Benchmarking:** We will conduct comprehensive evaluations of the trained model to assess its performance on various tasks such as language modeling, text completion, sentiment analysis, and more. Benchmarking against existing models will help us gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of BanglaGPT.

* **API Development:** To make BanglaGPT easily accessible and usable for developers, we will develop an API that allows users to interact with the model and integrate it into their applications. This will enable developers to leverage the power of BanglaGPT without needing to delve into the intricacies of model implementation.

* **Model Optimization:** We will continually work on optimizing the model architecture and training process to improve performance, reduce computational requirements, and enhance the overall efficiency of BanglaGPT. This includes exploring techniques like model compression, quantization, and efficient inference strategies.

* **Domain-Specific Adaptation:** BanglaGPT's general language understanding capabilities can be further enhanced by adapting it to specific domains. We plan to explore fine-tuning techniques to specialize the model for specific tasks and industries such as healthcare, finance, legal, and more.

## Contributing
